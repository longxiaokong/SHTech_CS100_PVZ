To create a project on Mac, go to the root direcotry and:

```zsh
cmake -G Xcode -B build
```

And in Xcode, remember to switch the working directory: 

`Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Run -> Options -> Working Diretory`

enable custom working directory to `<root of the project>/build/bin`

Feel free to switch to other generators.
